## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project was made to be a full stack application including front-end, back-end and mobile and will be used to the [Rocketseat](https://github.com/rocketseat) Gostack 9 certification.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Container Platform
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) - Package Manager

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

### Cloning Repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gregorispielmann/gympoint-gostack.git
```

### Containers

First of all you need to create the containers (Postgres and redis), after install docker run the following command on your terminal

```
$ docker run --name gympoint -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -p 5454:5432 -d postgres:11
To create the container for Postgres DB

And then

$ docker run --name redisgympoint -p 6363:6379 -d -t redis:alpine
To create the container to Redis
```

### Backend

To initialize the backend, enter backend folder and run yarn to install all dependencies. After this run the commands above to run the backend.

```
$ yarn dev
This will start backend in dev mode
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
